### moustacheOS

A community bot for the Ease Discord server. Not meant to be self hosted, but do whatever you please with it.

Before trying to start it, make a config.ts file with config.template, then use `yarn compile` to compile the files and `yarn start` to start the bot.
(It's more a server/api than a bot when you think about it.)
