### moustacheOS

A community bot for the Ease Discord server. Not meant to be self hosted, but do whatever you please with it.

Before trying to start it, make a config.ts file with config_template.ts, then use `yarn compile` to compile the files and `yarn start` to start the bot.
(It's more of a server/api than a bot when you think about it.)

Right now there is a ton of stuff happening and a lot of projects to be completed, if you're reading this, please consider looking at open issues and contributing to this project! All help is welcome.
